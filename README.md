# BLAST-ing-your-sequence-for-more-specific-taxonomic-IDs
For when you process 16S sequences and want to get a more specific ID than "unclassified Lactobacillus". This is a short guide on using the NCBI BLAST command line software to identify bacterial taxonomies using DNA sequences. We will go over pulling sequences from QIIME, formatting them for BLAST, running BLAST+, and sorting through the results.
